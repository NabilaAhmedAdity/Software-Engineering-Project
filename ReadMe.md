#Software Engineering Project


This is a simple project of Course Registration. The project is focused on basic implementation of some design patterns. 

Among 23 Gang of four design patterns only 9 are implemented:
1) Proxy Design Pattern
2) Factory Pattern
3) Adapter
4) Singleton Pattern
5) Strategy Pattern
6) Composite Pattern
7) Facade Pattern
8) Property Listener
9) Controller Pattern

See the UML diagram to understand the relationships between classes.


For database section I have used Netbean's builtin database Derby. My database only contains one table name Course_List. The table has six children: {ID: integer, Course_ID: string, Course_Title: string, Credit: int, Tution_Per_Credit: int, Description: string}
