#Software Engineering Project


This is a simple project of Course Registration. The project is focused on basic implementation of some design patterns. 

Among 23 Gang of four design patterns only 9 are implemented:
 - Proxy Design Pattern
 - Factory Pattern
 -  Adapter
 - Singleton Pattern
 - Strategy Pattern
 - Composite Pattern
 - Facade Pattern
 - Property Listener
 - Controller Pattern

See the UML diagram to understand the relationships between classes.


For database section I have used Netbean's builtin database Derby. My database only contains one table name Course_List. The table has six children: {**ID**: integer, **Course_ID**: string, **Course_Title**: string, **Credit**: int, **Tution_Per_Credit**: int, **Description**: string}
